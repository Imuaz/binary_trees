# 0x1D. C - Binary trees:zero::one:

**INTRODUCTION**

The project covered several key aspects of binary trees, including their definition and structure. It explained the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST). Additionally, it explored the potential gains in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists. The project also discussed important properties of binary trees, such as depth, height, and size. Moreover, it delved into various traversal methods used to navigate through binary trees. Finally, the project covered different types of binary trees, including complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees. Overall, the project provided a comprehensive understanding of binary trees and their characteristics.

 **Data structures**
 The following data structures and types  are use for binary trees,and are included the header file.
- Basic Binary Tree:
```
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```

```
**Note**: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they donâ€™t follow any kind of rule.
